            Up until now, we haven't moved elements very far from wherever the web
            browser automatically places them, but as you've probably noticed this has
            left our page very left side heavy
        </p>
        <p id="second">
            If your elements are still not exactly where you want them to be after
            adjusting the padding, margins and alignment, then you can try out the
            float property. The "float" property is one of the most powerful tools
            you can master when learning CSS.
        </p>
        <p id="third">
            Elements underneath a floating object will automatically wrap themselves
            around the content. For example, if you float an image, the text underneath
            will wrap around it so that none of it is actually obscured underneath
            the image.
        </p>
        <p id="last">
            The float property liberates an element from its automatic position and
            lifts it up to "float" on top of other elements in the direction you
            specify. You can specify float either right, left, or the default of none.
